  "description": "Subscore based on 1 item from Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, with a range of 0-3. A score of \"0\" indicates no difficulty, while a score of \"3\" indicates severe difficulty. [Buysse et. al 1989 (PubMed ID: 2748771)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2748771/) Seven component scores are derived, from 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (severe difficulty). The global score is the sum of the seven components (0 to 21), while higher scores indicate worse sleep quality. <br><br> [Search for all PSQI variables within this dataset](https://sleepdata.org/datasets/mros/variables?search=psqi)",
